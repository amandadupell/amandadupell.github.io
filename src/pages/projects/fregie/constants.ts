    SUMMARY: 'Food insecurity is a real problem faced by communities around the globe. Community fridges, also known as “freedges”, are crowdsourced pantries managed by volunteers with a passion for mutual aid. At Fregie, we saw the need for a centralized location tracker for these freedges, so we created this app to help people find community fridges and get involved in any way they can. \n \n Join our community as we fight food insecurity together.
